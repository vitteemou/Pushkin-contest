== Pushkin-contest

Pushkin-contest is a game that was suggested by Valentine Zavadski and Yuri Kaliada on their Ruby courses. The rules of the game are simple: to comlete levels guessing Pushkin poems by some given information (row of the random poem, row with replaced word and so on). The task was to create your own application that could guess poems instead of you.
